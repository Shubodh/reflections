When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I could access it from any PC and other people too could.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Clone - its like downloading a repository from remote server
Branches - can create two commits or more parallely
Forks - the remote commit thingy
